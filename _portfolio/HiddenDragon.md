Hidden Dragon is an [LSA Password Filter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002/) intended for use by the ISTS Red Team. This tool exfiltrates credentials using a lower-level network protocol and logs credentials on the host. These credentials are captured server-side using a Scapy script and displayed in a simple flask-app (primarily built by a colleague).
