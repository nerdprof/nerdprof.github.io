I am currently a senior lecturer in the Department of Computing Security at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I teach courses specializing in application security, offensive security, and auditing / penetration testing. In addition to teaching, I also serve as the Undergraduate Program Director and as Technical Director / Senior Penetration Tester for RIT's SAFE Lab. In the later role, I lead teams of students in performing largely IoT and traditional network penetration tests. In 2017, I was scoring lead for the NECCDC Black Team and in 2021, I acted as NECCDC Black Team lead in addition to acting as DevOps lead. Additionally, I volunteer as a member of the ISTS Red Team where I specialize in writing custom Windows implants and run initial deployment for the Windows subteam.
