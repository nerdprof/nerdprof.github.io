I am currently a senior lecturer in the Department of Computing Security at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I teach courses specializing in application security, offensive security, and auditing / penetration testing. In addition to teaching, I also serve as the Undergraduate Program Director and as Technical Director / Senior Penetration Tester for RIT's SAFE Lab. In the later role, I lead teams of students in performing largely IoT and traditional network penetration tests. In 2017, I was scoring lead for the NECCDC Black Team and in 2021, I acted as NECCDC Black Team lead in addition to acting as DevOps lead. Additionally, I volunteer as a member of the ISTS Red Team where I specialize in writing custom Windows implants and run initial deployment for the Windows subteam.

Some specific initiatives that I have been involved with include:
  1. Performing between 15 and 20 security assessments per year through RIT's SAFE Lab
  2. Assisting with the modernization of the curriculum including...
     - Development of CSEC: 201, Programming for Information Security, a required course covering systems programming concepts from a security perspective as well as exploit development
     - Facilitating the adopt of the basics of reverse engineering as a core subject
     - Updating our introductory course to address a wider variety of concepts as core topics. Subjects added include threat modeling, IAAA processes and procedures, software security, and a more detailed look at systems security.
     - Assisting in the redesign of our introductory programming sequence to be more focused around writing sustainable and reusable code.
  3. Promoting cybersecurity education outside of the classroom through a variety of cybersecurity competitions.
