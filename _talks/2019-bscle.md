The MITRE ATT&CK framework is all the rage these days. Many are looking at this as a research framework that can help standardize many aspects of information security, particularly with respect to offensive methodology. This talk will look at the MITRE ATT&CK framework from a different angle aby examining how the information MITRE has organized can improve penetration testing and, based on preliminary results, defensive posture. I will provide an overview of the ATT&CK framework, discuss the techniques that are useful for penetration testing, and present a case study of homebrew malware written to be aligned with the ATT&CK Framework. The talk will conclude with a discussion of using existing tools aligned with MITRE's ATT&CK Framework for detection and automating analysis of log data generated by those tools. It is important to note that this talk as supported by a significant amount of student work through both undergraduate and graduate capstone projects.
