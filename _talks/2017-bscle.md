Penetration testing is a challenge for higher education. Students are demanding this course in increasing numbers and faculty are scrambling to meet the demand. This talk will explore some of the curricular factors that influence why, where, and how higher education teaches penetration testing. Approaches to teaching this content can be wildly different, though, and can range from the theoretical to intensely technical. The strengths and weaknesses of these approaches will be discussed and some suggestions will be presented for how higher education can modernize their approach to teaching penetration testing.
