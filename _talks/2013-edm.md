Although educational data mining is a well-established field, it 
has not yet sought to provide serious, actionable intelligence that 
can be used by teachers to address bullying in a reasonable 
amount of time. This paper seeks to propose a system that will 
streamline the processing and storage of bullying data in social 
graph form so that it will be available to be mined by expert 
systems that can help educators in the classroom. In addition, one 
such expert system will be proposed demonstrating how this data 
may be used to automate a common classroom management task 
that may improve studentsâ€™ classroom experiences.
