In this paper, we describe the development of a software framework and its guiding principles for patient handling and processing in emergencies and disasters. The MEDTOC system developed earlier is modified and enhanced to include a complete object oriented software model for patient classification, patient handling and patient data processing. The client and server side processing is specified, the patient clustering considerations are discussed and initial results are outlined in terms of software models, algorithms and medical guidelines for effective collaboration.
