Cellular networks are becoming most prevalent network. Different applications are being deployed on them due to their ubiquity and reliability. We have been working on designing an emergency medical data transmission system named MEDTOC that would carry aggregated patient data on cellular network to the hospital. In this paper, we present an efficient scheme which implements the transfer of moving patient's vital signs to hospital via GSM network. This scheme was implemented and tested by writing a Java based client-server application to transfer patients' vital sign information. Post-transmission operations include archiving, classifying and presenting the vital signs data on demand. We have investigated the problem of classifying patients based on their condition, as assessed through vital signs. With that information, patients can be assigned to the appropriate physician for remote monitoring.
